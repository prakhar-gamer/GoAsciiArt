# Mp3 Cover Art to ASCII Cover Art

This uses Tag, a Go Libaray that lets you gets metadata from the Mp3, then extract the cover and convert it into colorful Ascii Art! 

## Why?
I personally love the terminal aeshteic, and this is the first part in my goal to make a music player cli, that uses all terminal features only, and this is the engine im gonna use to display the cover aeshteic

*used Tag, Go Sys, and Basic Libaries*

This is a smaller step in a bigger project! Look out For it!

## How To Use?
Basically write any name to create a folder and that is where the cover is going to be stored
then It asks for the directory with the music. You can put whatever u want
Then for the name, put the complete name NO SPACES(if ur song has a space the rename it) and include the extention .mp3 at the end
